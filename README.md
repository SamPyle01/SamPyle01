## Hello there 👋  

### I'm Sam  

🎓 **Master’s Student in Interaction Design at CSUEB**

I study interaction design with a focus on creating **cohesive, user-centered experiences**. My work blends **design thinking, data, and creative coding** to explore how people understand and interact with information, systems, and interfaces.

These coding projects help me become a stronger interaction designer by pushing me to think about **user flows, visual hierarchy, accessibility, feedback, and meaning-making**—not just how something looks, but how it *behaves* and *feels* to use.

### 🧠 How My Projects Support My Growth as an Interaction Designer

Through these projects, I practice:
- Translating complex information into **clear, intuitive interactions**
- Designing systems that respond to **user input and behavior**
- Iterating based on **usability, clarity, and engagement**
- Balancing **aesthetic decisions** with functionality and accessibility
- Collaborating and communicating design intent through interactive media

### 🔗 Featured Projects

**📊 Data Visualization Project**  
[View Project](https://sampyle01.github.io/P2---Data-Viz/)  
This project strengthened my ability to structure information visually, design meaningful interactions with data, and consider how users explore and interpret complex datasets.

**🪐 Personality Planets (Group Project)**  
[View Project](https://kimchampion.github.io/personality-planets/)  
A collaborative, narrative-driven interactive experience that helped me practice user flow design, metaphor-based interaction, and teamwork within a shared design system.
